## Website for MLPD

Hi,

This repository is to contain my personal website, Mark Limb Planning Design.

I'm currently learning how to use R in data management and analysis, as well as to undertake some basic programming. As a part of this I am also learning to use markdown.

This project is to help me learn some of these skills by creating and updating my own personal website.

I'm building this using Hugo and Netlify and making edits and changes in Rstudio using the Blogdown package. I've initially selected the [Hello Friend NG theme](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) for its minimal good looks and dark/light switching.

Mark
