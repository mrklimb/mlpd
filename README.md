## Website for MLPD

Hi,

This repository is to contain my personal website, Mark Limb Planning Design.

I'm currently learning how to use R in data management and analysis, as well as to undertake some basic programming. As a part of this I am also learning to use markdown.

This project is to help me learn some of these skills by creating and updating my own personal website.

Mark
